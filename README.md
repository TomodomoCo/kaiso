# Kais≈ç

Kaiso provides a barebones structure for building controller/view-powered WordPress themes.

It attempts to automatically route a WordPress request to a controller named to match the template you'd like to load. In effect, Kaiso turns the template hierarchy into a router.

## Setup

Kaiso is intended for use within an "app-style" WordPress instance. Our [TomodomoCo/starter-wp](https://github.com/TomodomoCo/starter-wp) framework is a good starting point. It's assumed you're using Composer.

**Step 1**<br>
Add this GitHub repo to your `repositories` block in Composer, add `"tomodomoco/kaiso": "dev-master"` to your require block, and hit `composer update`. The example setup also requires Twig, so install that too (`"twig/twig": "^2.0"` if you're on PHP7+) if you want to use the examples.

**Step 2**<br>
Copy the theme in the `example/theme` folder to your `wp-content/themes` directory (or wherever you place themes in your install).

**Step 3**<br>
Update the settings in the theme's `index.php` file, so the `controllerPath` matches your namespaced path to your controllers. (If you aren't autoloading your controllers, [you should do that](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#psr-4).)

**Step 4**<br>
Copy (and maybe modify) the controllers in `example/controllers/` and the views in `example/views/`; an `app/` folder in your project root is a good spot for them!

**Step 5**<br>
Activate the theme.

**Step 6**<br>
Load your site. You should see "Hello world!"

## FAQ?

**Wait, what?**<br>
That's an excellent question! Kaiso makes it easier to structure a WordPress project with real controllers and views via a modern template engine. It's probably not a solution for self-contained themes: it's best for projects where the theme and the functionality are intrinsically tied (for contexts where your WordPress site starts to look more like a powerful web app).

**I don't understand.**<br>
That's okay! If you are confused, Kaiso might not be right for you. There's nothing wrong with the way things work within WordPress; this just offers another option.

**Is it compatible with Plugin X?**<br>
Probably not. I mean, maybe. Yes?

Kaiso is sort of agnostic to plugins and themes. As far as I can tell, if you still output the right functions in the right places in your template layer, you should still have full compatibility with most plugins. I haven't tested it in detail with any plugins, but you're probably okay if you do everything else right.

**Should I use it in production?**<br>
I wouldn't recommend it. At least not yet, and certainly not if looking at the code makes your head spin.
